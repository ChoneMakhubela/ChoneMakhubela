-Gene Regulatory Network Inferences using Transformer-based models and scGPT

This project involved secondary data analysis based on studies by Cui et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2024). All analyses were conducted on the Ilifu high-performance computing platform using python programming Language v3.13.2. The workflow adopted for our analysis is outlined in the steps below.

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
The Immune All Human scRNA-seq dataset was sourced from the GitHub repository (Cui et al., 2024 that contains the code used in inferring GRNs and subsequently pre-processed using the scGPT model’s internal pipeline, which consisted of three sequential steps. The initial step was filtering, which removed low-quality data by setting a minimum gene count threshold. Next, normalization was performed, where gene expression values were adjusted based on the total read count per cell to account for library size differences. The final step involved feature selection, where Highly Variable Genes (HVGs) were selected to retain the most biologically informative genes for subsequent analysis.

scGPT-Based Gene Program Inference
Model Initialization and Feature Extraction
The pretrained scGPT foundation model (Cui et al., 2024) was loaded into a Jupyter Notebook environment. This model incorporates a Gene Encoder for discrete gene identities, a Value Encoder for continuous expression levels, and a 12-layer Transformer Core responsible for learning complex gene-gene dependencies. Data-independent gene embeddings were extracted from the model’s representations. A filtering step was applied to select genes present in both the dataset's HVGs and the scGPT model's comprehensive vocabulary (>30,000 genes), resulting in a final set of 1,200 genes for embedding analysis.

Clustering and Network Construction
The retrieved gene embeddings were used to construct a gene embedding network. Louvain clustering was performed on this network to partition genes into functional groups, or gene programs. To ensure biological relevance and stability, only clusters containing five or more genes were retained for subsequent analysis. A Cosine Similarity Network was then calculated between the identified gene programs, where edges represented the functional proximity of the programs, allowing for visualization of inter-program relationships.

scGREAT-Based Consensus GRN Inference
The scGREAT pipeline, which adapts the Transformer architecture for GRN inference, was applied to the same Immune Human Dataset. The Biobert model was utilized to generate numerical embeddings for 12,303 unique gene names in batches of 128, resulting in a (12,303, 768)-dimensional embedding matrix.
Sparse Network Generation and Correlation
An initial, sparse Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) was constructed using the k-Nearest Neighbours method, with k=50 to limit density. This generated an undirected graph of 12,303 nodes and 474,834 edges based on cosine similarity. Subsequently, an Expression Correlation Matrix was calculated using the Spearman method for the top 1,000 most active genes.

Consensus Network Filtering
A Consensus GRN was generated by combining the sparse network with the expression correlation data. To refine the visualization and focus on high-confidence interactions, a rigorous filtering step was performed, retaining only the top 5% of all edges based on regulatory weight. This final network was used for identifying and visualizing the Top 200 central genes (hubs).
Pathway and Functional Enrichment Analysis
Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the identified gene programs and regulatory hubs. Databases queried included Reactome, Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process (GO: BP), and GO Molecular Function (GO:MF) to identify the known biological pathways and molecular roles associated with the gene set. Statistical significance was reported as the {-log} _ {10} ({Adjusted P-value}).
